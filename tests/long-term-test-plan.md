# CodeQuest Achievement System - Long-Term Testing Plan

## Test Schedule (Recommended)

### Week 1: Basic Functionality
- [ ] Daily coding sessions (30+ min each)
- [ ] Track temporary achievement behavior  
- [ ] Verify permanent achievements persist across restarts
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during extended sessions

### Week 2: Edge Cases & Limits
- [ ] Trigger 10+ temporary achievements rapidly
- [ ] Test achievement cleanup after 30 seconds
- [ ] Verify oldest achievements are removed when limit exceeded
- [ ] Test with VS Code running for 8+ hours continuously

### Week 3: Integration Testing
- [ ] Complete multiple boss battles
- [ ] Build various combo levels (10x, 25x, 50x, 100x+)
- [ ] Test level progression through multiple milestones
- [ ] Verify achievement icons and descriptions are correct

### Week 4: Stress & Recovery Testing
- [ ] Generate 100+ achievements in rapid succession
- [ ] Test with corrupted storage data
- [ ] Monitor for memory leaks during heavy usage
- [ ] Test graceful degradation when system is overloaded

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Temporary Achievements
- [ ] Auto-expire after 30 seconds
- [ ] Limited to 10 max visible
- [ ] Oldest removed when new ones added
- [ ] No memory leaks from cleanup

### ✅ Permanent Achievements  
- [ ] Persist across VS Code restarts
- [ ] Survive system reboots
- [ ] No duplicates for same milestone
- [ ] Proper categorization and display

### ✅ Performance
- [ ] No noticeable UI lag during achievement display
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable over long sessions
- [ ] Achievement cleanup doesn't impact typing performance
- [ ] System gracefully handles edge cases

### ✅ Visual Quality
- [ ] Animations are smooth and not distracting
- [ ] Styling consistent with extension theme
- [ ] Text is readable and icons are appropriate
- [ ] Hover effects work correctly

## Monitoring Tools

### Memory Usage
```bash
# Monitor VS Code memory usage
Get-Process "Code" | Select-Object ProcessName, WorkingSet, CPU
```

### Achievement Storage Inspection
```javascript
// In VS Code Developer Console
console.log('Achievement Storage:', 
  vscode.workspace.getConfiguration().get('codequest.achievements'));
```

### Performance Profiling
```bash
# Enable VS Code performance monitoring
code --inspect-extensions
```

## Automated Testing Ideas

### Daily Achievement Generator
```javascript
// Script to automatically generate test achievements
setInterval(() => {
  // Simulate typing to trigger XP gains
  vscode.commands.executeCommand('type', { text: 'test code\n' });
}, 5000); // Every 5 seconds
```

### Memory Monitoring Script
```javascript
// Monitor memory usage over time
setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Memory Usage:', process.memoryUsage());
  console.log('Achievement Count:', 
    gameState.getAchievementsForDisplay().temporary.length);
}, 60000); // Every minute
```
